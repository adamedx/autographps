PoshGraph
=========
PoshGraph is a PowerShell-based CLI for exploring the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/) and the [Azure Active Directory Graph](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-operations-overview).

The project is in the earliest stages of development and not (yet) ready for collaborators, if ever. :)
