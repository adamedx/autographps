## AutoGraphPS 0.32.0 Release Notes

This release includes major breaking changes in command names, fixes significant defects in type-related functionality, and adds several features to existing commands. Some commands, such as `Get-GraphChildItem`, gain completely new behaviors.

### New dependencies

* AutoGraphPS-SDK 0.20.0

### Breaking changes

* Includes breaking changes from [AutoGraphPS-SDK 0.19.0](https://github.com/adamedx/autographps-sdk/releases/tag/v0.19.0) -- `Get-GraphItem` and `Remove-GraphItem` from `AutoGraphPS-SDK` have been renamed to `Get-GraphResource` and `Remove-GraphResource`
* `Get-GraphItemWithMetadata` has been renamed to `Get-GraphResourceWithMetadata`
* New implementations of `Get-GraphItem` and `Remove-GraphItem` are introduced in this module -- previously they were part of `AutoGraphPS-SDK` and had different functionality than the new version in this module

### New features

* `Get-GraphType` now supports tab-completion for output, so commands like select can be used interactively when building commands in the shell
* New `Get-GraphItem` command: a command with this name was in previous versions of the dependency module `AutoGraphPS-SDK`; this new command supports type-aware access of objects by `id` and other type-related facilities.
* New `Remove-GraphItem` command: a command with this name was in previous versions of the dependency module `AutoGraphPS-SDK`; this new command supports type-aware removal of objects by `id` and other type-related facilities.
* `Get-Graph` now returns an object with additional fields providing more information about the context of the Graph:
  * `Id`: The `Id` field is a guid that uniquely identifies the mounted Graph. If the same graph endpoint is mounted again, it will have a different `Id`. The property can be used for cases such as hashing.
  * `CreationTime`: The time, in the local time zone, at which the graph was mounted
  * `LastUpdateTime`: The time, in the local time zone, at which the graph was last updated by the `Update-GraphMetadata` command. If no such update occurred, the time is the same as the `CreationTime` property
  * `LastTypeMetadataSource`: The source of the type metadata used to define the graph when it was first mounted or last updated, which ever is ost recent. The source is either a URI to an http metadata source like https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata or the path to a local file containing the same format of data as that hosted at the http URI.
* The `ContentColumns` parameter of `Get-GraphChildItem` and `Get-GraphResourceWithMetadata` has been replaced by the `ContentOnly` parameter which has the following behavior: Instead of returning a uniform `PSCustomObject` with standard members including a `Content` member to access the actual content returned by Graph, the command just returns the actual content, just like the `Get-GraphResource` command.
* The `Get-GraphChildItem` command now also returns children of a type's entityset if applicable
* The `Get-GraphChildItem`, `Get-GraphItem`, and `Get-GraphResourceWithMetadata` commands now support the following parameters (with parameter-completion where applicable):
  * Paging parameter support: `First`, `Skip`, `IncludeTotalCount` parameters are now supported (as they are for the `Invoke-GraphRequest` and `Get-GraphResource` commands of `AutoGraphPS-SDK`).
  * `Expand`: Navigation properties may now be expanded (with parameter completion)
  * `Search`: For supported entities, an API-defined search query may be specified
  * `Sort`, `Descending`: Sorting by specified property (with parameter completion) may be specified
* Parameter completion is also supported for the `Expand` and `Sort` commands of `Invoke-GraphRequest` and `Get-GraphResource` when this module is installed.

### Fixed defects

* Graph API versions including `v1.0` and `beta` included multiple namespaces for API metadata after March 2020. Types outside of the `graph.microsoft` namespace were invisible to AutoGraphPS commands -- this has been fixed with support for multiple namespaces.
* Test execution in CI requires special module-specific logic to rename the AutoGraphPS-SDK modules installed for testing to lower case
* The `ContentColumns` parameter of `Get-GraphChildItem` and `Get-GraphResourceWithMetadata` has been regressed for several releases due to a syntax error which is now fixed.
* Inherited properties were absent from objects generated by `New-GraphObject`
* Inherited properties may be selected for the `Property` argument of `New-GraphObject`
* Fixed race condition in `Update-GraphMetadata` where some commands like `New-GraphObject` and `Get-GraphType` would not reflect the update
* Numerous parameter set fixes to `*-GraphItem*` commands including addressing consistency issues with the parameter sets
* Numerous fixes from commands included from the `AutoGraphPS-SDK` module
