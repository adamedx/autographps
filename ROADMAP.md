### Postponed

* Delay schema parsing at startup -- this didn't seem to improve startup perf, and the sleep we inserted took effect after the module was available for user input, which itself had a 10s + delay. Optimizing that delay would seem to be in order before putting in a delay to processing.

* # So offline allows you to set an offline mode in the drive provider -- providers will have both offline and online, or maybe metadata itself is a drive
* Show content in default list view?
* Change listview content from name to id?
* Make public graph items have id instead of name
* switch to 3 columns by default -- remove class

## Notes on specific problems

### Identity model

In order to authenticate as a user, you need the following:

1. An AppID -- this can just be hard-coded into the app
2. A login endpoint
3. A graph endpoint
4. User credentials
5. A tenant for the user credentials in the case of aad
6.  An authentication method

In order to authenticate as an app, you need the same thing, except

1a. You need a unique app id
4a. Instead of user credentials, you need an app secret


#### Proposed model

The model contains the following entities:

* Connection
  * Endpoint
    * Login endpoint - 2
    * graph endpoint - 3
    * Kind
  * Auth method - 6
  * Identity
    * Tenant - 5
    * App
      * ID - 1, 1a
      * Secret - 4a
      * Kind
    * User name - 4
    * Token - 4, 4a

So, this corresponds to the following non-leaf objects or enums from the list above:

```
class GraphConnection
    class GraphEndpoint
        enum GraphKind
    enum AuthMethod
    GraphIdentity
        GraphApplication
    GraphToken
```


## Stdposh fixes -- completed

These issues have been addressed -- see following section for details.

A key issue now is that each method is duplicated for every instance -- actually twice, since the type data is part of the instance and includes the entire class script.

A related problem is that of serialization. Currently methods and even hidden members are serialized as snapshots.

We might be able to use a type adapter to better solve the latter problem:
    https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/besidethepoint/2011/11/22/psobject-and-the-adapted-and-extended-type-systems-ats-and-ets/
    Derive from PSPropertyAdapter

In general though we need to simplify ScriptClass objects. Here are a few notes:

* NoteProperty members are serialized as you would expect, i.e. as JSON representations of themselves (expanded if their state is non-scalar).
  * NoteProperty members of type ScriptBlock are tostring()'d as the full script representation of the ScriptBlock, causing problems objects like ScriptClass (not good)
* ScriptProperty members are serialized as the output of calling the ScriptBlock, so a ScriptProperty with a highly complex function will still be serialized as the string form of "2" if that's what the function returns (good)
* Properties that are not part of the DefaultDisplayPropertySet are serialized anyway -- not good as these include "hidden" properties underlying the type
* ScriptMethod members are a good alternative to ScriptProperty members for read-only members that you want to prevent from being serialized and are ok with being "hidden" from property enumeration via DefaultDisplayPropertySet


The solution to the duplication problem and in some ways the formatting problem is something like the following:

* Make ScriptClass a ScriptMethod and implement set it to a DefaultDisplayProperty. It should return a value from the class table. It should also be hidden. The ScriptClass will look up the ScriptClass to find the actual class in the state table.
* Make all methods just invoke methods from the class table
* Make PSTypeName hidden unless it helps with type adapters

Now we need to add ToHashTable() -- this can be used eliminate the hidden members and then it can be serialized. In theory we can deserialize from it as well via a type adapter.

### How these issues were addressed

* Method duplication: Methods are actually defined in an external table referenced by the class, and there is only one instance of that table

## Entity data model type traversal

Ok, you can grab the entire data model (e.g. type definitions and associations) from the root of the versioned graph service + `$metadata`, i.e. `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata`. While consuming it can be rather convoluted for my purposes, it appears we can use it to answer the following questions which are key to our use cases:

1. An object was just returned to me -- what is its schematized type definition?
2. If I traverse a navigation property, what type will I get back?

### Getting the type of an entity
So it looks like we can use the `@odata.context` returned in every response. Here's how I think it works:

Let's say you get an `@odata.context` like the following after a `GET` to https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root/children. You'll get an `@odata.context` like this:

    @odata.context             : https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users('5e3d030a-cb5c-4c5e-afbe-3c4513c2c962')/drive/root/children/$entity

Ok, so the alphanumeric string after `$metadata` is the *entity set* that contains the type, i.e. `users`. Now if you've already retrieved all the metadata (you need to pre-process and cache it -- it's huge), just look up the entity set and get the `entitytype` object -- you'll get `Microsoft.DirectoryServices.User`.

And now you have the type.

### Determining the type of the entities returned by a navigation property

Imagine that you've retrieved an entity and you'd like to know what other entities are reachable from it. How do you do this? The ability to get the type for an entity or entity set as described earlier is what helps us here:

1. Get the type of the entity as described in the previous section
2. Enumerate the navigation properties of that type
3. Each navigation property has a "Target" attribute -- this is the entity set that this property returns
4. Use the entity set again as above to obtain the actual type

### What are the next Graph URL segments?
The tricks described earlier, combined with some knowledge of how Graph constructs URL's, will let you determine how to find the next possible segments in the URL. We'll describe the algorithm below. To make it easier to understand, we give some analogies for OData terminology that pervades the schema:

* Entity: These are essentially "objects" that can be described with a schema. The schema is a set of properties with unique names within the entity. An entity has exactly one schema that describes it. Each property has a scalar or complex type and an associated value that conforms to that type.
* EntityType: This is the infinite class of all entities that share the same schema that could ever exist. Each EntityType is associated with exactly one EntitySet.
* EntitySet: One or more finite subsets of an EntityType -- it can be thought of as a database table, where each row is an entity. Rows may have different columns depending on the EntityType of the entity for that row
* Singleton: An alias to a single instance of a particular entity that is accessed outside the context of an EntitySet
* Navigation property: this is a property whose value is itself a subset of some EntitySet.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Every Entity is a member of exactly one and only one EntitySet.
* EntitySets can contain entities of more than one EntityType

An important (to me) note is that the name *Graph* is constantly invoked but its descriptive applicability is never explained in any reference I've seen. I use the definitions from the data model above to suggest a clear definition how of the *Graph* conforms to the technical definition of Graph:

> *Graph* can be described as a graph because its data model can be mapped to the formal definition of graph. Specifically, a graph is an object G(V,E) where V is a set of of vertices and E is a set of ordered pairs (u,v) where u and v are members of V. This has an exact correspondence for *Graph* where union of the data model's EntitySet corresponds to V, and all entities in the graph are the members of V. The edges E correspond to each ordered pair of entities such that a navigation property of the first entity in the pair refers to a set that contains the second entity in the pair.

To put it simply, entities are the vertices of the graph, and navigation properties are the (sets) of edges.

And here are some axioms about how Graph URL's are structured with regard to the data model. In dicussing the URL, we ignore the service URI and its version, segment e.g. we will not mention `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/`.

* The first URL segment is either the name of an EntitySet or a Singleton
* The second segment is either an entity identifier if the first segment was an EntitySet, or a navigation property if the first was a singleton
* Any segment after the two above is either an entity if the preceding segment referred to a navigation property, or a navigation property if the preceding segment was an entity set.

In generic graph terms, the Graph URL segments are structured in the following way if we consider each segment a vertex, and say that there is an edge from one segment to another if that segment can precede the other segment in the URL:

* There exists a set of vertices with no incoming edges. These vertices are labeled either singletons or entitysets. These vertices can reach every other vertex in the graph that is not a singleton or entityset vertex, and these are the only such vertices.
* For all other vertices there is at least one incoming edge -- these vertices are called entities.
* Singleton vertices and entitiy vertices, there is an edge to one more more entity vertices if that entity contains a non-empty navigation property

### Algorithm for finding the next segment from the previous segment

With the above definitions, we can obtain the possible values for the next segment from the previous segment. Note that in order to retrieve entities, we need to actually query the Graph service, but schematically we can usually refer to a placeholder since the entity will have a specific entiytype in all cases except where it is preceded by an entityset segment. In the case of entitysets, the specific type is ambiguous in many cases, i.e. where the set of all schemas defines more than one type as included in an entityset. In the worst case, we could allow interrogators to select from a list of possible types and then continue to traverse the URI.

Here is an algorithm:

Let R be the set of the names of all singletons and entitysets from the schema. We define the root of URI R to be the versioned service URI S, e.g. https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0. If U is a graph URI of the form `S/U1/U2/...UN` where S is the predecessor of U1 and UN-1 is the predecessor of UN, the successor of segment UN can be determined as follows:

If S is the predecessor of UN, then UN may be the name of any of the members of R

If the predecessor of UN is an entityset or a navigationproperty that returns a collection, then UN may be any of the identifiers of any of the entities in the entityset or returned by the navigation property. A query can be made to determine those identifiers.

If the predecessor of UN is an entityset or a navigationproperty that returns a single entity, then UN may be any of the navigation properties of the type of the entity returned by the navigation property.

If the predecessor of UN is a singleton or an entity identifier, then UN may be the name of any of the navigation properties of the singleton or entity


### Example output for compressed list view
PowerShell's default `ls` (i.e. get-childitem) and Unix's `ls` both have a "mode" column that gives compressed information about the item in the list. Output can be very repetitive for `class` and `type` fields, especially when enumerating a collection, so compressing this into one field and then using one field for something that's unique, say the actual content, could be more appealing.

For example, this:

    Relation   Class     Type                  Name
    --------   -----     ----                  ----
    Collection EntitySet contract              contracts
    Data       Singleton deviceAppManagement   deviceAppManagement
    Data       Singleton deviceManagement      deviceManagement
    Collection EntitySet device                devices
    Data       Singleton directory             directory
    Collection EntitySet directoryObject       directoryObjects
    Collection EntitySet directoryRole         directoryRoles
    Collection EntitySet directoryRoleTemplate directoryRoleTemplates
    Collection EntitySet domainDnsRecord       domainDnsRecords

Could be

Location (bool) , Source (bool), Kind (char), Size (bool

Kind

### Replacing -json with -rawcontent

Here are the cmdlets using -json:

* Invoke-GraphRequest
* Get-GraphItem.ps1
* Get-GraphSchema.ps1
* Get-GraphVersion.ps1
* Test-Graph.ps1
* Get-GraphChildItem.ps1


### Another try at the 'Info' column

The 'Class' column is not very useful -- other than at the root, it's always the same for all results when actions and funtions are excluded, which is the normal case.

So let's stick it in the Info column.
'\>' is equivalent to 'not executable.'

Hmm, didn't like it :(.

Update: added 'Preview' column, so we ended up removing the 'Class' column and moving it to 'Info,' so in the end we did do a version of this.

### OrderBy support
I thought it was possible to specify a named parameter more than once in a PowerShell cmdlet, looks like this is not the case. In that case, to support multi-column sorts with arbitrary ascending / descending directions, we'll have to go beyond basic parameters and add extra interpretation to the values. Unfortunate.

Here's an attempt

```powershell
ggi /me/messages -first 10 -orderby Received -descending
ggi /me/messages -first 10 -orderby Received -descending
ggi /me/messages -first 10 -orderby @{Received=$true;Sender=$false}
```

### Get-GraphChildItem logic
The goal is for it to "feel" like ls / dir commands for the file system.

If we look at ls, it has the following behavior:

1. With no arguments, it has the same behavior as an argument of '.', the current directory
2. With an argument, the following happens:
   a. If the argument is has content rather than being a container, it simply returns information about that container
   b. If the argument is a container, it enumerates the current directory

We'd like to imitate that with `Get-GraphChildItem`, but there is a challenge:

> For Graph items, unlike file system items, the properties of possessing content and being containers are not mutually exclusive

That means we cannot differentiate between 2a and 2b above.

Perhaps, though, we don't have to -- we can apply some rule, e.g. a precedence, over what behavior to take for cases where Graph items fall into both categories. We could evaluate such approaches by how useful, deterministic, and intuitive they feel to users.

Here is a proposal -- here `gls` refers to `Get-GraphChildItem`:

1. We define "container" as EntitySet, or NavigationProperty.
2. When `gls` receives no argument, it enumerates all children of the current object and does not include the current object
   * This allows `cd`/ `ls` style browsing
3. When `gls` receives an argument and the argument is a container, the argument's children are returned and not the current object
   *
4. When `gls` receives an argument and the argument is not an entity, only the entity is returned.
   * This allows "selecting" a specific item
5. The switch `ItemAndChild` causes the argument and the children to be returned.
6. Another alias / function can proxy and always give the `ItemAndChild` behavior
7. We could make another command that `gls` aliases -- that way `Get-GraphChildItem` can retain the consistent container semantics expected in the `Get*-ChildItem` cmdlets.

### Set-GraphItemProperty parameters
Parameter sets in decreasing order of common usage. Basic issue is computing the abstract parameters:

* The target object -- there are various ways to describe this, but ultimately it must resolve to a URI. Options are:
  * By type + id
  * By Uri
  * By Uri (parent) + Id
  * By object
  * By object + type
  * By Uri (parent) + object
* The properties to set and their values -- this is the set of properties to change to specified values. This must ultimately resolve to a set P of properties with a 1:1 mapping to the set V of values.
  * By parallel list
  * By hash tables
  * By JSON object

```powershell

# Looks like parameters have the following parameterset counts
# TypeName: 8
# Uri: 6
# InputObject 4
# TemplateObject: (8+6+4)/2 = 9, Property: (8+6+4)/2 = 9, Value: (8+6+4)/2 = 9

# Default: TypeAndIdList

# By type name

# TypeAndIdList
# TypeAndIdMap
Set-GraphItemProperty user userid prop1, prop2 val1, val2
Set-GraphItemProperty user userid -TemplateObject @{prop1=val1;prop2=val2}

# By object

# TypedObjectList
# TypedObjectMap
$existing | Set-GraphItemProperty prop1, prop2 val1, val2
$existing | Set-GraphItemProperty -TemplateObject @{prop1=val1;prop2=val2}

# ObjectAndTypeList
# ObjectAndTypeMap
$existing | Set-GraphItemProperty user prop1, prop2 val1, val2
$existing | Set-GraphItemProperty user @{prop1=val1;prop2=val2}

# By property

# TypeAndPropertyNameList
# TypeAndPropertyNameMap
# UriParentAndPropertyNameList
# UriParentAndPropertyNameMap
Set-GraphItemProperty user -ByProperty name -ByValue myname prop1, prop2 val1, val2
Set-GraphItemProperty user -ByProperty name -ByValue myname @{prop1=val1;prop2=val2}
Set-GraphItemProperty -uri /users -ByProperty name -ByValue myname prop1, prop2 val1, val2
Set-GraphItemProperty -uri /users -ByProperty name -ByValue myname -TemplateObject @{prop1=val1;prop2=val2}

# By Uri

# UriList
# UriMap
# UriParentAndObjectList
# UriParentAndObjectMap
Set-GraphItemProperty -uri /users/userid prop1, prop2 val1, val2
Set-GraphItemProperty -uri /users/userid -TemplateObject @{prop1=val1;prop2=val2}
$existing | Set-GraphItemProperty -uri /users prop1, prop2 val1, val2
$existing | Set-GraphItemProperty -uri /users -TemplateObject @{prop1=val1;prop2=val2}


```

### Get-GraphItem vs. Get-GraphResource

As new write commands `New-GraphItem`, `Add-GraphItemReference`, `Set-GraphItemProperty` are added,
it becomes clear that these commands are not symmetric with the pre-existing "Item" commands
`Get-GraphItem` and `RemoveGraph-Item`. The newer commands are dependent on metadata, while the older
ones are not. The newer commands allow the user to specify Graph locations by type + id or
even by passing in an object obtained form the Graph, the older ones do not.

To resolve this, the following refactoring of the commands across modules is made, along with
clarification of their purposes:

* The existing `Get-GraphItem` and `Remove-GraphItem` commands will be renamed `Get-GraphResource` and `Remove-GraphResource`. They will remain in the `autographps-sdk` module as their purpose and dependencies aligns with that of the module: enable access to the Graph solely via REST without any dependency on metadata. The noun *Resource*" is actually appropriate here as the interface for these commands is URI-based, i.e. *Uniform Resource Identifier*-based.
* New versions of `Get-GraphItem` and `Remove-GraphItem` will be implemented in `autographps` rather than `autographps-sdk`. These commands will conform to the selection facilities used by `Set-GraphItemProperty` and the other new commands to specify a specific object.
  * `Get-GraphItem` will use `Property` rather than select to specify properties, other search / filter capabilities will probably be removed.
  * `Get-GraphItem` will output fully resolved type URIs via `Get-GraphUri`.
  * The default parameterset for `Get-GraphItem` may actually be URI-based -- URI's work for all cases, where type + id only works for entity types and does not return collections.
    * We could make a single element parameter set assume a singleton, a two-element parameter set a type + id, and `Uri` would have to be explicit.
* `Get-GraphChildItem` will be re-implemented using the same selection capability as `Get-GraphItem`.
* `Get-GraphItemWithMetadata` will be changed to `Get-GraphResourceWithMetadata`.
* The `gls` alias will continue to point to `Get-GraphResourceWithMetadata` as its behavior conforms more closely to the user experience of `ls` than `Get-GraphChildItem` does.
* Note that `AutoGraphPS` core aliases preserve the idea of resource-based navigation of the Graph vs. retrieving objects, and this is even compatible with the new commands which support a `Uri` parameter which is compatible with the navigable resource paradigm.

#### New Get-GraphChildItem parameters

`Get-GraphChildItem` will have all the parameters of `Get-GraphItem` in addition to the following:

* `PropertyFilter`: constructs a where clause of conjoined property equality expressions
* `Filter`: allows for the user of an arbitrary OData filter
* `Search`: allows use of OData search

#### Multiple namepsace support

Because types can refer to types defined in other namespaces, we'll need to continue to provide a "merged" view across all namespaces. So we might as well maintain the GraphDataModel class as that source of merged types.

Alternatively, the type provider and metadata components that consume the data model could process multiple data models, but this complexity must be duplicated in both contexts. The merged data model still seems to hold value.

Here is a suggestion on how to implement this:

* The existing data model becomes ScopedAPIModel
* A new implementation of GraphDataModel merges all those APIs
  * This should eventually be renamed, something like GraphAPIModel or CompositeAPIModel

##### Name qualification

To qualify a name, the following approach is used:

* There is a default namespace, microsoft.graph
* If a namespace is specified, that namespace is used to qualify
* If no namespace is specified, then all namepaces are searched for the unqualified name:
  * If there is exactly one match, it is used to qualify
  * If there is more than one match and there is a match with the default namespace, qualification uses the default namespace
  * If there is more than one match but none from the default namespace, an exception is given, even though there are multiple matches in other namespaces

Since the no-namespace case can result in non-matches due to the lack of a defined mechanism for multiple matches, it should be considered non-deterministic and used only as an "aid" or heuristic for assisting humans in understanding types, e.g. as in auto-complete scenarios.

##### Name unqualification

The complementary unqualification method is used:

* The default namespace is microsoft.graph
* If a namespace is specified, that namesapce is used to unqualify
* If no namespace is specified, then all namespaces are searched for the qualified name:
  * If exactly one namespace is found that has a type with that qualified name, that namespace is used to unqualify.
  * If multiple are found and there is a match in the default namespace, the name is unqualified agains the default namespace
  * If multiple are found and there is no match in the default namespace, an exception is thrown

As in the qualification method, unqualification without a known namespace should not be attempted outside of scenarios where failure is not fatal, e.g. "best-effort" UX assistance in comprehending types.

##### Assumptions and refactoring considerations

Currently numerous code locations assume a single namespace -- this needs be changed in multiple places:

* GraphDataModel should no longer have a namespace, but a default namespace
* The EntityGraph and all classes it references must associate a specific namespace to each vertex
  * The EntityGraph itself must not have a namespace -- instead it should have a default namespace
* The TypeProvider classes and other parts of the type system, including the Types themselves must specific a specific namespace
* Type qualification operations currently seem to specify a namespace, but those operations must ensure that the correct namespace, not an assumed global or uniform namespace is used, and this will likely require additional refactoring.

##### Notes from multi-namespace investigation

Here are the methods currently exposed by GraphDataModel:

TypeName: GraphDataModel

    Name                                 MemberType   Definition
    ----                                 ----------   ----------
    GetActions                           ScriptMethod System.Object GetActions();
    GetComplexTypes                      ScriptMethod System.Object GetComplexTypes();
    GetEntitySets                        ScriptMethod System.Object GetEntitySets();
    GetEntityTypeByName                  ScriptMethod System.Object GetEntityTypeByName();
    GetEntityTypes                       ScriptMethod System.Object GetEntityTypes();
    GetFunctions                         ScriptMethod System.Object GetFunctions();
    GetMethodBindingsForType             ScriptMethod System.Object GetMethodBindingsForType();
    GetNamespace                         ScriptMethod System.Object GetNamespace();
    GetSchema                            ScriptMethod System.Object GetSchema();
    GetScriptObjectHashCode              ScriptMethod System.Object GetScriptObjectHashCode();
    GetSingletons                        ScriptMethod System.Object GetSingletons();
    UnaliasQualifiedName                 ScriptMethod System.Object UnaliasQualifiedName();
    UnqualifyTypeName                    ScriptMethod System.Object UnqualifyTypeName();

Other class notes:

* For TypeProvider, there is a GetGraphNamespace -- this is redundant as there is a GetDefaultNamespace, and in any event the graph can only have a default namespace in the multi-namespace model.
  * Perhaps GetGraphNamespace should be GetGraphDefaultNamespace
* CompositeTypeProvider has a namespace, and this will need to be changed
  * It also has a default namespace, which it gets from the EntityGraph, so this is ok
* ScalarTypeProvider hard-codes the namespace for primitive types, which is fine
  * But it assumes all enumeration types come from the same (default) namespace so this must be changed
* Fortunately, TypeDefinition *does* have a namespace, and this means we can use it, assuming it is correctly initialized
* Entity also has a namespace (and alias), so this should be ok
* The new GraphDataModel should return a namespace when returning any schema information
  * We can define a new class, e.g. SchemaElement, that includes schema data and the namespace
* Everything else must use fully qualified names

### Config files for user experience
Let's add configuration files as a UX affordance! Here are the high-level requirements:

* Configuration should make it easy to use the non-default appid and other authentication related scenarios
* Configuration should support multiple tenants
* We should use concepts and conventions from other command-line tool configuration
* Configuration should be easy to turn off
* It should not be too complicated to use
* It should be transparent -- users should not need to guess if they are impacted

#### More details


* What can be configured?
  All parameters of New-GraphConnection
* Where is the config located?
  ~/.autograph/settings.json
* What is the general format of the file?
  Tough call between yaml and json, but we'll go with json for now
  vscode uses camel-casing -- why? Maybe we should also (Graph does).
* How is it organized?
  * Profiles: Like VSCode, it will define profiles
    * Named with a friendly, unique name (not a guid like vscode profiles)
    * Contains default connection info
    * Contains ConnectionProfile
    * Contains log level option
    * Prompt option
  * Default profile option
  * No metadata option?
* What new commands are needed?
  First, settings related commands start with "local" for the noun
  * Get-GraphLocalSettingsLocation
  * Set-GraphLocalSettingsLocation
  * Update-GraphLocalSettings? Needed if it's important to avoid module reload
  * Get-GraphLocalConnectionProfile (including -current)
* What commands are modified?
  * New-GraphConnection would take arguments:
    * Profile \<name\>
    * NoProfile
  * Connect-GraphApi would take the same argument
    * Should profile be the default parameter set? Probably
* What environment variables?
  * AUTOGRAPH\_BYPASS\_SETTINGS -- this allows the user to ignore any settings that might be persisted
  * AUTOGRAPH\_SETTINGS\_FILE -- point at a different settings file
* How is setting data shared across autographps and autographps-sdk modules?
  * An internal class, LocalSettings, will cover it

### Color output

Well, there's nothing like adding some color, so long as it's optional. Here are the ideas:

* Use format xml to generate color output
* Provide a low-level library for generating color strings
* Looks like even the lowly windows console can support 24-bit ansi escape sequences
* Provide a default that uses only 16 colors, allow enabling 8-bit and 24-bit support
* We can have a preference variable
* Allow customization via themes
* Here's what we can color
  * Log output -- use color to indicate success / failure and the http method
  * Native object output: de-emphasize '@' properties, brighten id, maybe 'name' and 'displayname'
  * Hmm, in a 16 color palette, it's hard to find colors that will work regardless of console color scheme
    * Limited to Cyan, Yellow, Green, and Blue. Red usually means "error," and magenta won't work against a purple background.
  * Output of gls:
    * Info: Hmm, color turns out to not be very useful here since everything in list results has the same "info" and thus same color
    * Preview? Yes -- this draws attention away from "type" column, which is easy to confuse with "id" for navigation properties or singletons / entity sets
    * Type: This draws attention from Preview and Id, which should be the real stars
    * Id: ok, here we background and foreground shades of cyan, yellow, green. Collections have background (like ls in Ubuntu)

#### Color principles

* Use color for the purpose of conveying information efficiently, not gratuitously; overuse dilutes effectiveness and can even make the experience unpleasant
* Even still, it's ok to use color for fun where it doesn't hurt anything :)
* Try to have consistency about the meaning of colors in the following areas:
  * Errors -- this is typically red. There may be "hard" errors that indicate an outage for example, and "softer" errors that can be corrected by the user such as an expired certificate. A state that is surfaced in a command that indicates a bad configuration (again, the expired certificate) but that has not necessarily been exercised and may not have yet caused an error would also fall into the latter category. In these cases, the person seeing the error should take an action of some sort, even if it's just to file a support case.
  * Emphasis -- in a set of data, what should stand out? Typically a key property such as a display name that clarifies the object's purpose might need to be called out. This would generally be a static determination, not a runtime or conditional coloring based on a variable state.
  * Enabled -- this is useful for capabilities, e.g. local preferences that can be enabled or disabled.
  * Contrasting types -- in heterogeneous lists, there may be significantly different actions that can be taken based on the class of the element. E.g. listing the contents of a file system location, where some elements are files, and others are directories that contain other files and provide the extra capability of traversal. These two use cases may warrant contrasting colors to indicate the different classes. Symbolic links in the file system may also warrant specific coloring.
  * Domain-specific -- of course, in certain areas, there may already be a convention, so if that presentation can be isolated from other use cases, it's ok to adopt a coloring that deviates from the consistently applied approach

A suggested approach: Errors: Red background for hard errors, red foreground for softer errors; Emphasis: Bright Yellow; Enabled: Green, disabled gray; Contrasting types: Use Cyan, Blue, Magenta for top contrasting categories, and use background color for containment capabilities;
