### Done

* get-graphschema
* model for identity
* get-graphtoken
* get-graphversion
* invoke-graphrequest
* support version in invoke-graphrequest
* support json output
* Re-implement get-graphitem
* add basic scopes
* Support paging through results

* add paging interface to graph enumeration commands

### Postponed

* transform schema, version objects to hashtables

#### Stdposh improvements

* Fix initializers, use scriptblock for non-string object types
* Add private methods
* Private fields
* strict-val for pscustomobjects
* remove script-level variables
* inheritance

#### Finished stdposh improvements

* Store methods per class rather than per instance to save space

## Notes on specific problems

### Identity model

In order to authenticate as a user, you need the following:

1. An AppID -- this can just be hard-coded into the app
2. A login endpoint
3. A graph endpoint
4. User credentials
5. A tenant for the user credentials in the case of aad
6.  An authentication method

In order to authenticate as an app, you need the same thing, except

1a. You need a unique app id
4a. Instead of user credentials, you need an app secret


#### Proposed model

The model contains the following entities:

* Connection
  * Endpoint
    * Login endpoint - 2
    * graph endpoint - 3
    * Kind
  * Auth method - 6
  * Identity
    * Tenant - 5
    * App
      * ID - 1, 1a
      * Secret - 4a
      * Kind
    * User name - 4
    * Token - 4, 4a

So, this corresponds to the following non-leaf objects or enums from the list above:

```
class GraphConnection
    class GraphEndpoint
        enum GraphKind
    enum AuthMethod
    GraphIdentity
        GraphApplication
    GraphToken
```


## Stdposh fixes

A key issue now is that each method is duplicated for every instance -- actually twice, since the type data is part of the instance and includes the entire class script.

A related problem is that of serialization. Currently methods and even hidden members are serialized as snapshots.

We might be able to use a type adapter to better solve the latter problem:
    https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/besidethepoint/2011/11/22/psobject-and-the-adapted-and-extended-type-systems-ats-and-ets/
    Derive from PSPropertyAdapter

In general though we need to simplify ScriptClass objects. Here are a few notes:

* NoteProperty members are serialized as you would expect, i.e. as JSON representations of themselves (expanded if their state is non-scalar).
  * NoteProperty members of type ScriptBlock are tostring()'d as the full script representation of the ScriptBlock, causing problems objects like ScriptClass (not good)
* ScriptProperty members are serialized as the output of calling the ScriptBlock, so a ScriptProperty with a highly complex function will still be serialized as the string form of "2" if that's what the function returns (good)
* Properties that are not part of the DefaultDisplayPropertySet are serialized anyway -- not good as these include "hidden" properties underlying the type
* ScriptMethod members are a good alternative to ScriptProperty members for read-only members that you want to prevent from being serialized and are ok with being "hidden" from property enumeration via DefaultDisplayPropertySet


The solution to the duplication problem and in some ways the formatting problem is something like the following:

* Make ScriptClass a ScriptMethod and implement set it to a DefaultDisplayProperty. It should return a value from the class table. It should also be hidden. The ScriptClass will look up the ScriptClass to find the actual class in the state table.
* Make all methods just invoke methods from the class table
* Make PSTypeName hidden unless it helps with type adapters

Now we need to add ToHashTable() -- this can be used eliminate the hidden members and then it can be serialized. In theory we can deserialize from it as well via a type adapter.
